Direction
=========

Reference for the :mod:`gtFrame.direction` module.
This module implements direction vectors which rotate with changing frames of
reference, but are not impacted by translation of those references. This can be
achieved with the :class:`gtFrame.direction.Direction2d` and
:class:`gtFrame.direction.Direction3d` classes, which hold the direction
vector as coordinates and the frame of reference on which it is defined.
