Position
========

Reference for the :mod:`gtFrame.position` module.
This Module is designed to give a position vector which is linked with a frame
of reference for increased usability. This way one must not keep track of which
vector is defined in which frame of reference but rather just create the
Position2d or Position3d objects, which will handle conversion and comparision.
